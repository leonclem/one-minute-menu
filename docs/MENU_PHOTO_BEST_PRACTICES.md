# Menu Photo Best Practices

## Overview

This guide helps restaurant owners capture high-quality menu photos for optimal AI extraction results. Following these best practices will ensure accurate extraction and minimize manual corrections.

## Quick Tips

✅ **Good lighting** - Natural light or bright indoor lighting  
✅ **Hold steady** - Avoid blur by keeping camera still  
✅ **Flat angle** - Photograph menu straight-on, not at an angle  
✅ **Fill the frame** - Menu should take up most of the photo  
✅ **Avoid glare** - No reflections from lights or windows  

## Detailed Guidelines

### 1. Lighting

**Best Practices:**
- Use natural daylight when possible (near a window)
- Ensure even lighting across the entire menu
- Avoid harsh shadows that obscure text
- Use bright indoor lighting if natural light isn't available

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Dark or dim environments
- ❌ Strong backlighting (menu in shadow)
- ❌ Uneven lighting (half bright, half dark)

### 2. Camera Position

**Best Practices:**
- Hold camera directly above or in front of menu (perpendicular)
- Keep menu flat on table or against wall
- Fill the frame with the menu (minimize background)
- Ensure all text is in focus

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Angled shots that distort text
- ❌ Too much distance (text too small)
- ❌ Partial menu in frame
- ❌ Blurry or out-of-focus images

### 3. Menu Condition

**Best Practices:**
- Use clean, unfolded menus
- Flatten any creases or wrinkles
- Ensure text is clearly visible
- Remove any obstructions (hands, objects)

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Folded or crumpled menus
- ❌ Menus with stains or damage obscuring text
- ❌ Fingers or hands covering parts of the menu
- ❌ Other objects in the frame

### 4. Glare and Reflections

**Best Practices:**
- Adjust angle to avoid reflections from lights
- Use matte or non-glossy menus when possible
- Tilt menu slightly if glare is unavoidable
- Turn off camera flash

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Bright reflections covering text
- ❌ Flash photography on glossy menus
- ❌ Window reflections
- ❌ Overhead light reflections

### 5. Multi-Page Menus

**Best Practices:**
- Photograph each page separately
- Ensure consistent lighting across all pages
- Keep pages in order for easier organization
- Use landscape orientation for wide menus

**For Large Menus:**
- Consider photographing sections separately
- Overlap sections slightly to avoid missing items
- Process sections one at a time for better accuracy

### 6. Image Quality

**Best Practices:**
- Use your phone's main camera (not front camera)
- Ensure resolution is at least 1024x1024 pixels
- Save as JPEG or PNG format
- Keep file size under 8MB

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Low-resolution images
- ❌ Over-compressed images
- ❌ Screenshots of photos (use original)
- ❌ Heavily edited or filtered images

## Common Menu Types

### Single-Column Menus
- Photograph entire menu in one shot
- Ensure all items are clearly visible
- Check that category headers are included

### Multi-Column Menus
- Capture all columns in one photo if possible
- If menu is too wide, photograph sections separately
- Maintain reading order (left to right)

### Folded Menus
- Unfold completely before photographing
- Photograph each panel separately if needed
- Flatten any creases

### Chalkboard/Whiteboard Menus
- Ensure high contrast between text and background
- Avoid glare from board surface
- Use bright, even lighting
- Consider photographing at a slight angle to reduce glare

### Digital Display Menus
- Photograph screen directly (not at angle)
- Adjust brightness to avoid glare
- Ensure text is sharp and readable
- Turn off camera flash

## Troubleshooting

### "Image quality too low for reliable extraction"

**Solutions:**
- Retake photo in better lighting
- Move closer to menu
- Clean camera lens
- Use a newer phone or better camera

### "Extraction completed with low confidence"

**Solutions:**
- Check for glare or reflections
- Ensure menu is flat and not angled
- Verify all text is in focus
- Retake photo with better lighting

### "Some items need review"

**Solutions:**
- Check if those items were unclear in photo
- Verify lighting was even across entire menu
- Consider photographing problematic sections separately
- Review and correct flagged items manually

## Examples

### ✅ Good Example
```
- Bright, even lighting
- Menu fills frame
- Text is sharp and clear
- No glare or reflections
- Flat, straight-on angle
```

### ❌ Poor Example
```
- Dim lighting
- Menu at an angle
- Blurry text
- Glare covering prices
- Partial menu in frame
```
