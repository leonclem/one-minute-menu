# Admin Access Control - Complete Summary

## Overview
All admin dashboards are now protected with role-based access control (RBAC). Only users with `role = 'admin'` in the `profiles` table can access these pages.

## Protected Admin Pages

### 1. Extraction Metrics Dashboard
**Path**: `/admin/extraction-metrics`  
**Purpose**: Monitor extraction performance, costs, and quality metrics  
**Requirements**: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 12.1, 12.5

### 2. Platform Analytics Dashboard
**Path**: `/admin/analytics`  
**Purpose**: View platform-wide usage metrics and AI generation statistics  
**Requirements**: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3

### 3. Extraction Feedback Dashboard
**Path**: `/admin/extraction-feedback`  
**Purpose**: Review user feedback on extraction quality and system errors  
**Requirements**: 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.4

## Access Control Behavior

### For Admin Users (role = 'admin')
- ✅ Full access to all admin dashboards
- ✅ Can view platform-wide metrics
- ✅ Can review user feedback
- ✅ Can monitor costs and performance

### For Regular Users (role = 'user')
- ❌ Redirected to `/dashboard` when attempting to access admin pages
- ❌ Admin links hidden in dashboard UI (Analytics link, View details link)
- ✅ Can access their own dashboard and menus
- ✅ Can submit feedback (but not view all feedback)

### For Unauthenticated Users
- ❌ Redirected to `/auth/signin` when attempting to access admin pages
- ❌ Must authenticate before accessing any protected resources

## Implementation Details

### Server-Side Protection

All admin pages use the `requireAdmin()` utility function:

```typescript
import { requireAdmin } from '@/lib/auth-utils'

export default async function AdminPage() {
  await requireAdmin() // Redirects non-admins
  
  // Admin-only code here
}
```

### UI Conditional Rendering

Admin-only links are conditionally rendered in the UI:

```typescript
import { getCurrentUser } from '@/lib/auth-utils'

export default async function DashboardPage() {
  const currentUser = await getCurrentUser()
  const isAdmin = currentUser?.role === 'admin'
  
  return (
    <>
      {isAdmin && (
        <Link href="/admin/analytics">Analytics</Link>
      )}
    </>
  )
}
```

**Hidden UI Elements for Non-Admin Users:**
- Analytics link in dashboard header
- "View details →" link in AI Image Generation card

## Security Features

1. **Server-Side Only**: All role checks are performed server-side
2. **Database-Backed**: Roles are stored in the `profiles` table with RLS
3. **Automatic Redirects**: No manual redirect logic needed in each page
4. **Type-Safe**: TypeScript ensures role values are valid
5. **Auditable**: All admin access can be logged and monitored

## Quick Reference

### Assign Admin Role
```sql
UPDATE profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'admin@example.com';
```

### Remove Admin Role
```sql
UPDATE profiles SET role = 'user' WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

### List All Admins
```sql
SELECT id, email, role, plan, created_at 
FROM profiles 
WHERE role = 'admin';
```

### Check User Role
```sql
SELECT email, role FROM profiles WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

## Testing Checklist

### Database & Migration
- [ ] Apply migration `012_add_user_roles.sql`
- [ ] Verify `role` column exists in `profiles` table
- [ ] Assign admin role to test user

### Admin Page Access
- [ ] Test `/admin/extraction-metrics` as admin (should work)
- [ ] Test `/admin/analytics` as admin (should work)
- [ ] Test `/admin/extraction-feedback` as admin (should work)
- [ ] Test all admin pages as regular user (should redirect to `/dashboard`)
- [ ] Test all admin pages as unauthenticated user (should redirect to `/auth/signin`)

### UI Conditional Rendering
- [ ] Login as admin user
- [ ] Verify "Analytics" link appears in dashboard header
- [ ] Verify "View details →" link appears in AI Image Generation card
- [ ] Logout and login as regular user
- [ ] Verify "Analytics" link is hidden in dashboard header
- [ ] Verify "View details →" link is hidden in AI Image Generation card

### General
- [ ] Verify no console errors or warnings
- [ ] Verify redirects happen instantly without flash of content
- [ ] Verify admin links work correctly when clicked

## Support

If you encounter issues with admin access:

1. Verify the migration has been applied
2. Check the user's role in the database
3. Ensure the user is properly authenticated
4. Check server logs for authentication errors
5. Verify RLS policies are correctly configured

- [ ] Create admin UI for role management
- [ ] Add more granular permissions
- [ ] Implement role-based API access controls
- [ ] Add email notifications for role changes
