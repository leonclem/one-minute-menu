# Task 21.1 UI Enhancements - Admin Link Visibility

## Overview
Enhanced the dashboard UI to conditionally show admin-only links based on user role, preventing confusion for regular users who cannot access admin pages.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard Header - Analytics Link
**File**: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Before**:
```typescript
<Link href="/admin/analytics">Analytics</Link>
```

**After**:
```typescript
{isAdmin && (
  <Link href="/admin/analytics">Analytics</Link>
)}
```

**Behavior**:
- ✅ Admin users: See "Analytics" link next to their email in the header
- ❌ Regular users: Link is completely hidden from the UI

### 2. AI Image Generation Card - View Details Link
**Files**: 
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` (passes prop)
- `src/components/QuotaUsageDashboard.tsx` (renders conditionally)

**Before**:
```typescript
<a href="/admin/analytics">View details →</a>
```

**After**:
```typescript
{showAdminLink && (
  <a href="/admin/analytics">View details →</a>
)}
```

**Behavior**:
- ✅ Admin users: See "View details →" link in the AI Image Generation summary card
- ❌ Regular users: Link is completely hidden, but the card and quota information remain visible

## Implementation Details

### Server-Side Role Check
The dashboard page uses `getCurrentUser()` to check the user's role on the server:

```typescript
import { getCurrentUser } from '@/lib/auth-utils'

export default async function DashboardPage() {
  // ... existing code ...
  
  const currentUser = await getCurrentUser()
  const isAdmin = currentUser?.role === 'admin'
  
  // Pass to components or use in conditional rendering
  return (
    <>
      {isAdmin && <AdminOnlyLink />}
      <QuotaUsageDashboard showAdminLink={isAdmin} />
    </>
  )
}
```

### Component Props
The `QuotaUsageDashboard` component now accepts an optional `showAdminLink` prop:

```typescript
export default function QuotaUsageDashboard({ 
  variant = 'full',
  showAdminLink = false
}: { 
  variant?: 'full' | 'summary'
  showAdminLink?: boolean
}) {
  // ... component code ...
}
```

## User Experience

### For Admin Users
1. Login to dashboard
2. See "Analytics" link in header (next to email)
3. See "View details →" link in AI Image Generation card
4. Both links work and navigate to admin pages
5. Seamless access to admin features

### For Regular Users
1. Login to dashboard
2. No "Analytics" link in header (cleaner UI)
3. No "View details →" link in AI Image Generation card
4. Can still see their quota usage and limits
5. No confusion about inaccessible features

## Security Notes

1. **Defense in Depth**: Even though links are hidden, the admin pages themselves still have server-side protection via `requireAdmin()`
2. **No Client-Side Bypass**: Role check happens on the server, not in browser JavaScript
3. **Clean UI**: Users only see features they can actually use
4. **Consistent Experience**: Both UI hiding and page protection use the same role check logic

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **As Admin User**:
   ```
   - Login as admin
   - Navigate to /dashboard
   - Verify "Analytics" link appears in header
   - Verify "View details →" link appears in AI card
   - Click both links to verify they work
   ```

2. **As Regular User**:
   ```
   - Login as regular user
   - Navigate to /dashboard
   - Verify "Analytics" link is NOT visible in header
   - Verify "View details →" link is NOT visible in AI card
   - Verify AI Image Generation card still shows quota info
   - Try to manually navigate to /admin/analytics (should redirect)
   ```

3. **Role Switching**:
   ```
   - Login as regular user, verify links hidden
   - Update user role to admin in database
   - Refresh dashboard
   - Verify links now appear
   ```

### Automated Testing Considerations

Future tests could verify:
- Admin users see admin links in rendered HTML
- Regular users don't see admin links in rendered HTML
- Links have correct href attributes
- Clicking links navigates to correct pages

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
   - Import `getCurrentUser` from auth-utils
   - Check user role on server-side
   - Conditionally render Analytics link
   - Pass `showAdminLink` prop to QuotaUsageDashboard

2. `src/components/QuotaUsageDashboard.tsx`
   - Add `showAdminLink` prop to component signature
   - Conditionally render "View details →" link based on prop

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Users don't see links they can't use
2. **Less Confusion**: No "Access Denied" scenarios from clicking visible links
3. **Cleaner UI**: Dashboard is more focused for regular users
4. **Consistent Security**: UI visibility matches actual permissions
5. **Maintainable**: Single source of truth for role checks

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add role-based feature flags for other UI elements
- Create a reusable `<AdminOnly>` wrapper component
- Add loading states while checking role
- Cache role check results for performance
- Add analytics to track admin feature usage
