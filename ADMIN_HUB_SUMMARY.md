# Admin Hub - Consolidated Dashboard

## Problem Solved

Previously, admin functionality was scattered across three separate pages:
- `/admin/extraction-feedback`
- `/admin/extraction-metrics`
- `/admin/analytics`

This was getting "out of control" as mentioned. The solution consolidates everything into a single, organized Admin Hub.

## New Structure

### Central Hub: `/admin`

A tabbed interface with five sections:

1. **Overview** - Quick stats and alerts dashboard
2. **Cost Monitoring** - Spending tracking and controls
3. **Extraction Metrics** - Performance and quality metrics
4. **Platform Analytics** - Usage statistics
5. **User Feedback** - Extraction feedback review

## Key Features

### Cost Controls (Task 25)

✅ **Spending Caps:**
- Daily global: $50.00
- Monthly global: $500.00
- Daily per-user: $0.50
- Monthly per-user: $5.00

✅ **Automatic Enforcement:**
- Service disables when caps exceeded
- Alerts at 75% (warning) and 90% (critical)
- Budget checks before each extraction

✅ **Cost Optimization:**
- Image preprocessing (resize, compress)
- Idempotency via SHA-256 hash
- Prompt optimization (temperature=0)
- Target: ≤$0.03 per extraction

### Overview Dashboard

- Real-time spending metrics with progress bars
- Automatic alert generation
- Quick action buttons
- Key performance indicators

### Admin API Enhancements

**GET `/api/admin/costs`**
- Returns spending summary, top spenders, current caps
- Admin role required

**PATCH `/api/admin/costs`**
- Update spending caps
- Admin role required
- Input validation

## Access

- **URL**: `/admin`
- **Auth**: Admin role required (redirects non-admins to `/dashboard`)
- **Legacy pages**: Still accessible for backward compatibility

## Files Created

```

├── admin-hub-client.tsx        # Client component with tabs

├── AnalyticsTab.tsx            # Analytics wrapper
└── FeedbackTab.tsx             # Feedback review
```

## Next Steps

1. Test the new admin hub with admin user
2. Consider deprecating old separate pages
3. Add cap management UI (form to update caps)
4. Implement email/Slack alerts for critical thresholds
5. Add cost trend charts

## Migration Path

The old pages still work, so there's no breaking change. Users can:
1. Start using the new `/admin` hub immediately
2. Gradually migrate workflows
3. Deprecate old routes in a future update

This provides a smooth transition without disrupting existing admin workflows.
