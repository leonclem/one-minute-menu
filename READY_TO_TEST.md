# âœ… Nano Banana Integration - Ready to Test!

## What's Been Fixed

The Nano Banana API integration is now fully configured and working! Here's what was done:

### 1. Identified the Real API âœ…
- **Nano Banana** = Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model
- Model: `gemini-2.5-flash-image`
- Endpoint: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash-image:generateContent`

### 2. Updated Implementation âœ…
- Fixed `src/lib/nano-banana.ts` to use correct Gemini API format
- Request format: Gemini's `contents` structure with `responseModalities: ["image"]`
- Response parsing: Extracts base64 images from `candidates[].content.parts[].inlineData.data`

### 3. Verified API Access âœ…
- Billing is enabled on your Google Cloud project
- API key is working correctly
- Successfully generated test images (2.37MB PNG files)

### 4. All Code is Ready âœ…
- No TypeScript errors
- No linting issues
- All components are properly integrated

## How to Test

### Option 1: Test in Your App (Recommended)

1. **Start your Next.js dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open your app:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Navigate to a menu item:**
   - Go to Dashboard â†’ Menus
   - Select a menu
   - Click on a menu item to edit it

4. **Generate an image:**
   - Click the "Add Photo" dropdown
   - Select "Create Photo"
   - Choose a style preset (e.g., "Professional Food Photography")
   - Click "Generate"
   - Wait ~10-15 seconds
   - You should see a real AI-generated food image!

### Option 2: Test the API Directly

Run the test script to verify the Nano Banana API:
```bash
node test-gemini-image.js
```

This will generate a test cheeseburger image and show you the response.

## What You Should See

### Before (Old Mock):
- Green placeholder square (1x1 pixel PNG)
- No real image generation

### After (Real Nano Banana):
- High-quality AI-generated food images
- Professional food photography style
- Realistic dishes based on your menu item descriptions
- Images are ~2-3MB in size (1024x1024 PNG)

## Expected Behavior

1. **Click "Create Photo"** â†’ Modal opens with style presets
2. **Select a style** â†’ Style is highlighted
3. **Click "Generate"** â†’ Progress bar appears
4. **Wait 10-15 seconds** â†’ Image generation in progress
5. **Image appears** â†’ Real AI-generated food photo!
6. **Click "Use This Image"** â†’ Image is saved to your menu item

## Troubleshooting

### If you see quota errors:
- Wait a few minutes for quota to reset
- Check your Google Cloud billing is active
- Verify API key in `.env.local`

### If images don't appear:
- Check browser console for errors
- Check Next.js server logs
- Verify Supabase is running (`supabase status`)

### If you see the green square:
- Clear your browser cache
- Restart the Next.js dev server
- Check that `.env.local` has the correct API key

## API Costs

With billing enabled, Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) costs:
- **Free tier**: 15 requests/minute, 1,500 requests/day
- **Paid tier**: Very affordable, typically $0.002-0.004 per image

For a restaurant menu app, costs should be minimal (a few cents per day).

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Test image generation in your app
2. âœ… Verify images are saved correctly
3. âœ… Test different style presets
4. âœ… Generate images for multiple menu items
5. ðŸŽ‰ Enjoy real AI-generated food photos!
