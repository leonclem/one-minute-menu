# Image Upload Fix - Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Next.js 14+ Params Issue âœ…
**Problem**: 404 error when uploading images
**Root Cause**: Next.js 14+ requires dynamic route params to be awaited as Promises
**Fix**: Changed params from `{ params: { itemId: string } }` to `{ params: Promise<{ itemId: string }> }` and added `await`

**Before**:
```typescript
export async function POST(
  request: NextRequest,
  { params }: { params: { itemId: string } }
) {
  const { itemId } = params
```

**After**:
```typescript
export async function POST(
  request: NextRequest,
  context: { params: Promise<{ itemId: string }> }
) {
  const { itemId } = await context.params
```

### 2. Image URL Not Saved to Database âœ…
**Problem**: Uploaded images weren't being associated with menu items
**Fix**: Added database update to save the image URL to `menu_items.custom_image_url`

```typescript
// Update the menu item with the new image URL
const { error: updateError } = await supabase
  .from('menu_items')
  .update({ custom_image_url: publicUrl })
  .eq('id', itemId)
```

### 3. Remove Photo Not Working âœ… (Issue #1)
**Problem**: DELETE endpoint didn't update the database
**Fix**: Added database update to clear the image URL

```typescript
// Update the menu item to remove the image URL
const { error: updateError } = await supabase
  .from('menu_items')
  .update({ custom_image_url: null })
  .eq('id', itemId)
```

## Test It Now

1. **Restart your dev server** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Upload an image**:
   - Go to a menu item
   - Click "Add Photo" â†’ "Upload Photo"
   - Select an image file
   - Should upload successfully and appear on the menu item

3. **Remove an image**:
   - Click "Remove photo" button
   - Image should disappear from the menu item
   - Toast should show "Image has been removed..."

## What's Fixed

- âœ… Issue #5: Upload image error (404)
- âœ… Issue #1: Remove photo button now works
- âœ… Uploaded images are now saved to the database
- âœ… Images are properly associated with menu items
