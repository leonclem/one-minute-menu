# Issues to Fix - Summary

## âœ… Fixed

### Issue #5: Upload Image Error (FIXED)
**Problem**: Module not found error when uploading images
**Solution**: Fixed import in `src/app/api/menu-items/[itemId]/image/route.ts` to use correct Supabase client
**Status**: âœ… Complete - You can now upload images

---

## ðŸ”§ Remaining Issues

### Issue #1: Remove Photo Button Doesn't Work
**Problem**: Clicking "Remove photo" shows success toast but image doesn't get removed
**Location**: Menu item editor
**What happens**: Toast says "Image has been removed..." but the image stays
**Likely cause**: The DELETE handler in `/api/menu-items/[itemId]/image` doesn't update the menu_items table
**Fix needed**: Update the DELETE handler to also clear the `custom_image_url` field in the database

### Issue #2: Image Thumbnail Not Clickable
**Problem**: When an image is created, the thumbnail should be clickable to view full size
**Current behavior**: Thumbnail is displayed but not interactive
**Expected behavior**: Click thumbnail â†’ Open modal/lightbox with full-size image
**Fix needed**: Add click handler to thumbnail that opens image in a modal or new tab

### Issue #3: Description Not Used in Image Generation
**Problem**: When creating an image, if there's a description, it should be included in the prompt
**Current behavior**: Only uses item name for image generation
**Expected behavior**: Use both name and description to create better prompts
**Fix needed**: Update prompt construction in `src/lib/prompt-construction.ts` to include description

### Issue #4: 404 Error When Generating Image for New Item
**Problem**: Adding a new item and immediately trying to create an image results in 404
**Error**: `POST /api/generate-image 404 in 28ms`
**Likely cause**: Menu item ID might not be properly saved/synced before image generation starts
**Fix needed**: Ensure menu item is fully saved before allowing image generation, or add better error handling
